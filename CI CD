(CI) continuous integration, (CD) countinuos deployment and also (CD) continuous delivery is a process of software 
delivery by automating task like build, test and deploy.

ðŸ”˜Countinuous Integration --
    1. Code Commit:  A developer makes changes to the codebase and commits them to a version control system (VCS) like Git.
    2. Code Checkout: The CI pipeline retrieves the latest committed code from the VCS repository.
    3. Build Stage: The code is compiled or assembled into a usable format
    4. Test Stages:
        o Unit tests (verify individual code units)
        o Integration tests (ensure different code parts work together)
        o Static code analysis (identifies potential issues without running code)

ðŸ”˜Continuous Delivery --
    1. Leverage CI:
          CD relies on a well-established CI pipeline that performs automated builds, tests, and generates feedback for code changes.
    2. Code Promotion (Optional):
          After successful testing in the CI pipeline, the code might be promoted to a staging environment. 
          allowing for final testing and validation before pushing to live users.
    3. Automated Deployment:
          Upon successful completion of all stages (CI and potentially staging), the CD pipeline triggers an automated deployment process. 
          This involves packaging the approved code into a deployable artifact and sending it to the production environment.
    4. Environment Management:
          CD tools often manage deployments across different environments (staging, production, etc.). 
          They can automate configuration changes and ensure consistency between environments.
5. Approval Gates (Optional):
          In some CD pipelines, there might be manual approval gates before deploying to production. 
          This allows for human oversight and control over critical releases.
6. Monitoring and Rollbacks:
          After deployment, CD pipelines often integrate with monitoring tools to track the health and performance of the application in production.
          If issues arise, some CD pipelines can facilitate rollbacks to previous versions if necessary.

ðŸ”˜continuous Deployment -- Automates the entire deployment process (Continuous Delivery), including pushing the code live to production.

                        Trigger:
                        
                        on: This section defines the event that triggers the pipeline workflow. In this case, the pipeline runs:
                        When there's a push to the main or master branch.
                        Job:
                        
                        jobs: This section defines a single job named build-and-deploy. This job performs all the build, image creation, and deployment tasks within the pipeline.
                        Job Steps:
                        
                        Checkout Source:
                        
                        This step uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to check out the source code from the GitHub repository.
                        Configure AWS Credentials:
                        
                        This step uses the aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v3 action to securely configure AWS credentials for the pipeline to interact with AWS services.
                        It retrieves the access key ID and secret access key from GitHub Secrets, which are secure environment variables stored within the repository.
                        Login to Amazon ECR:
                        
                        This step uses the aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2 action to log in to the Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) where the Docker image will be stored.
                        Build, Tag, and Push Image to Amazon ECR:
                        
                        This step performs the following actions:
                        Builds a Docker image using the docker build command.
                        Sets environment variables for the image tag (latest), ECR registry URI (ECR_REGISTRY), and ECR repository name (ECR_REPOSITORY). These variables are used within the command.
                        Pushes the built image to the specified ECR repository using docker push.
                        Saves the image URI (including registry, repository, and tag) in a GitHub output variable named image for later use.
                        Fill in the New Image ID in the Amazon ECS Task Definition:
                        
                        This step uses the aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1 action to update an existing ECS task definition file (node-app-task.json).
                        It replaces a placeholder for the container image (image) with the actual image URI retrieved from the previous step ({{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}).
                        This ensures the task definition references the newly built and pushed image.
                        Deploy Amazon ECS Task Definition:
                        
                        This step uses the aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1 action to deploy the updated ECS task definition.
                        It specifies the following details:
                        task-definition: The path to the updated task definition file ({{ steps.task-def.outputs.task-definition }}).
                        service: The name of the ECS service that needs to be updated with the new task definition (node-app-service).
                        cluster: The name of the ECS cluster where the service is running (nodejs-app-DEV).
                        wait-for-service-stability: This option (set to true) ensures the pipeline waits for the ECS service to stabilize after the deployment before finishing.
                        Overall Functionality:
                        
                        When a push occurs to the main or master branch, the pipeline triggers.
                        The pipeline retrieves AWS credentials securely and logs in to ECR.
                        It builds a Docker image, pushes it to ECR, and updates the ECS task definition with the new image URI.
                        Finally, it deploys the updated task definition to the specified ECS service, ensuring a smooth update process.
