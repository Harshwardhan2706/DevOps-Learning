Everything you need to know to become a Great DevOps Engineer!!


1. Basics of SDLC
Understand how is a software created and where do ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù fall in Software Development Life Cycle.
"SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is the step-by-step process that software goes through, from planning and coding to testing and deployment.

"‚ùóYou don't have to get too detailed; just a grasp of software deployment processes and DevOps basics is sufficient. However, hands-on experience with the below technologies üëáüèæ is more valuable and beneficial."


2. Operating System (Linuxüêß) 
As a DevOps engineer, you manage the servers where applications run. 
Linux is the go-to choice for servers, and Most DevOps tools are Linux-based; so  knowing linux commands helps a lot in server management and handling Devops Tasks. 
"What to learn:
Shell Commands
SSH for remote access
Virtualization 
Text Editors for File Editing (vim, nano)
File System Permissions 
Package Management (apt, yum)
Process and Service Management (ps, kill)"	

‚úèÔ∏è Things you can do to practice Linux:
Web Server setup
Database setup
User and Group Management
Install Different Devops tools (docker, jenkins, terraform etc)
"Popular Linux Distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Arch linux and more.
Best way to learn is to have Linux as OS for your laptop, but you can also spin up servers on Cloud, WSL or virtualbox."

3. Scripting/Programming
After you learn the basics of Linux, use your knowledge to create scripts.

"DevOps Engineers automate tasks to streamline software delivery and enhance efficiency. Scripting is typically carried out using OS-based languages such as BASH and Powershell, or standalone languages like Python or Golang."	


‚úèÔ∏è How is scripting used in DevOps
 Backup Automation
Working with APIs
Integration with other devops tools
 System Cleanup Automation
 Email Notification Script
 Software Update Automation
 Log Analysis Automation
 Network Diagnostics Script
 Data Transformation Automation
 User Account Management Script

"If you have a question - Do devops engineer require coding? 
The answer is yes,  DevOps engineer needs coding knowledge, not necessarily for application development, but to utilize tools, SDKs, and scripting for seamless integration and automation in the DevOps workflow."

4. Git for Version Control
Version control, using Git, is important for tracking changes in code, collaborating with teams, ensuring a reliable history of software development, and facilitating essential DevOps practices such as CI/CD, GitOps, and storing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files.

"What should you know:
1. Branching:
   - Create, switch, and delete branches.
   - Understand the role of feature branches.
2. Git Commands:
   - Master basic commands (init, clone, add, commit, push, pull, merge).
   - Explore advanced commands (rebase, cherry-pick) for complex workflows.
3. Pull/Merge Requests:
   - Create, review, and merge pull requests (GitHub) or merge requests (GitLab).
   - Emphasize collaborative code review practices.
4. GitHub/GitLab :
   - Learn how to use and store code on remote git repositories."


Git is Important to work as DevOps engineer but also helps if want to make open source contributions üëç

5. Networking & Security üîê
"With rise in DevSecOps, incorporating security practices into the entire development lifecycle is vital. This ensures proactive identification and early addressing of security concerns. Having solid networking knowledge is crucial for securing systems, enabling the configuration of firewalls and implementation of essential network security measures."


Concepts to know:
- IP Addressing
- Ports and Protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS)
- Network Services (DHCP, DNS)
- Routing and Switching Basics
- Authentication and Authorization
- Security Best Practices
- Shift-Left Security
- Firewalls and Network Security

6. Learn any one Cloud 
Companies now prefer deploying applications on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP instead of on-premise. This shift enables organizations to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency provided by cloud services.

"AWS is most popular cloud provider. Other popular ones are Microsoft azure, Google cloud Platform, Oracle cloud etc."


What should you know as a DevOps Engineer:
for AWS, you should know the basics of:
1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Create isolated networks.
2. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Manage virtual servers.
3. S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable object storage.
4. RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed databases.
5. IAM (Identity and Access Management): Secure access control.
6. Lambda: Serverless code execution.
7. Route 53: Scalable DNS service.
8. CloudWatch: Monitoring and observability.
9. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration

‚úèÔ∏è Tip!
Once you master and get certified in any one cloud, it‚Äôs easy to learn others.
Popular cloud certifications for DevOps engineers include AWS Certified DevOps Engineer ‚Äì Professional, Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert, and Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer. 



7. Infrastructure as Code üìÉ
Tools like Terraform and Ansible uses the IaC concept to automate the manual creation and configuration which are time consuming and error prone. 


Using IAC we code to create and configure infrastructure & there are 2 types of IAC tools:
Infrastructure Provisioning
Configuration Management
"Infrastructure Provisioning
Creating virtualized resources programmatically, such as servers in the cloud, using tools like Terraform to define and deploy infrastructure."	"Configuration Management
Ensuring consistent configurations of virtualized resources over time, managed through code, for example using Ansible playbooks to define and enforce server "


Benefits of having everything in code -
Ensures consistency accross different environments (stage, dev, prod)
Can be stored and version controlled and collaborated.
Less chances of issues or configuration errors.
Saves time avoiding to repeat creation and configuration.

8. Microservices and Containerization üì¶
Microservices is the new way to deploy applications independently for better scaling and management, and they are packaged in a container. üì¶


"Container: A packaged application with its dependencies, isolated for easy deployment, and capable of running consistently on any machine."

Docker is the most popular container technology.

What should you know
Microservices and Containerization concepts
How to write docker files? (Containerize the application)
Docker Commands (build, run, exec, ps )
How to push and pull docker images in DockerHub

11. Monitoring and Logging
Once the software is released you need to continuosly monitor it to track performance and discover problems


"Monitoring in DevOps serves the purpose of identifying and addressing issues early on, providing benefits such as enhanced performance, ensured reliability, and support for proactive maintenance. 
Key aspects include monitoring software, infrastructure, and user experience, ultimately resulting in a resilient and continuously improving software delivery process.

Logging captures system events for troubleshooting and performance monitoring, providing insights for issue diagnosis, ensuring reliability, and supporting data-driven decisions in software delivery."


Popular tools used for Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Cloudwatch, Nagios, ELK etc

Git
CICD
IaC


Popular GitOps tools : ArgoCD and FluxCD
