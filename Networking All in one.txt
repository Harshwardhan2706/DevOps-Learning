üîòIP Addressing ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  unique identification tag for a device on network, It allows other devices to find and send information to your computer or device.
  This number, typically written as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

  ‚óè Versions: There are two main IP address versions:

    IPv4: The original version, uses 32 bits and is written as four numbers between 0 and 255. Due to the growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses are becoming       scarce.
    IPv6: The newer version, uses 128 bits and provides a much larger pool of addresses. It's written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by           colons   (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

  ‚óè Assignment: IP addresses can be assigned in two ways:

    Static IP: A fixed address manually configured on a device. This is common for servers or network equipment.
    Dynamic IP: An address automatically assigned by a server (like DHCP) when a device connects to a network. This is common for home users and mobile devices.

  ‚óè Public vs. Private IP:

    Public IP: An address that identifies a device on the public internet.
    Private IP: An address used for internal networks and not directly accessible from the internet. There are specific reserved ranges for private IPs.
