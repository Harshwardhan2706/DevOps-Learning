üîòIP Addressing ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  unique identification tag for a device on network, It allows other devices to find and send information to your computer or device.
  This number, typically written as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

  ‚óè Versions: There are two main IP address versions:

    IPv4: The original version, uses 32 bits and is written as four numbers between 0 and 255. Due to the growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses are becoming       scarce.
    IPv6: The newer version, uses 128 bits and provides a much larger pool of addresses. It's written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by           colons   (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

  ‚óè Assignment: IP addresses can be assigned in two ways:

    Static IP: A fixed address manually configured on a device. This is common for servers or network equipment.
    Dynamic IP: An address automatically assigned by a server (like DHCP) when a device connects to a network. This is common for home users and mobile devices.

  ‚óè Public vs. Private IP:

    Public IP: An address that identifies a device on the public internet.
    Private IP: An address used for internal networks and not directly accessible from the internet. There are     specific reserved ranges for private IPs.

Subnetting ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    A subnet mask, in the world of IP addressing (IPv4 specifically), is a 32-bit number that acts like a          divider,  separating an IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address.

  ‚óè Example: 
    A common subnet mask for a home network might be 255.255.255.0. In binary, this translates to           
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. Here, the first three octets (24 bits) with all ones represent the        network address, and the last octet (8 bits) with all zeros signifies the host portion.

CIDR ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a way to manage IP addresses more efficiently.

  ‚óè CIDR Notation: 
    CIDR uses a notation like  "IP address/prefix length". For example, 192.168.1.0/24 represents an IP       
    address with a /24 prefix length. This prefix length indicates the number of contiguous 1s in the subnet       mask (out of 32 bits for IPv4). In this case, /24 signifies a subnet mask of                                   255.255.255.0 (first 24 bits are 1s).
