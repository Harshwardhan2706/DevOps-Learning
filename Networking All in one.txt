üîòIP Addressing ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  unique identification tag for a device on network, It allows other devices to find and send information to your computer or 
  device.
  This number, typically written as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

  ‚óè Versions: There are two main IP address versions:

    IPv4: The original version, uses 32 bits and is written as four numbers between 0 and 255. Due to the growth of the internet, 
    IPv4 addresses are becoming scarce.
    IPv6: The newer version, uses 128 bits and provides a much larger pool of addresses. It's written as eight groups of 
    hexadecimal numbers separated by colons   (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

  ‚óè Assignment: IP addresses can be assigned in two ways:

    Static IP: A fixed address manually configured on a device. This is common for servers or network equipment.
    Dynamic IP: An address automatically assigned by a server (like DHCP) when a device connects to a network. This is common for 
    home users and mobile devices.

  ‚óè Public vs. Private IP:

    Public IP: An address that identifies a device on the public internet.
    Private IP: An address used for internal networks and not directly accessible from the internet. There are     specific 
    reserved ranges for private IPs.

Subnetting ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    A subnet mask, in the world of IP addressing (IPv4 specifically), is a 32-bit number that acts like a divider,  separating an 
    IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address.

  ‚óè Example: 
    A common subnet mask for a home network might be 255.255.255.0. In binary, this translates to           
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. Here, the first three octets (24 bits) with all ones represent the network address, and 
    the last octet (8 bits) with all zeros signifies the host portion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üîòCIDR ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a way to manage IP addresses more efficiently.

  ‚óè CIDR Notation: 
    CIDR uses a notation like  "IP address/prefix length". For example, 192.168.1.0/24 represents an IP       
    address with a /24 prefix length. This prefix length indicates the number of contiguous 1s in the subnet mask (out of 32 bits 
    for IPv4). In this case, /24 signifies a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (first 24 bits are 1s).

üîòOSI Model ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  The OSI model, also known as the Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework that defines how network    
  communication occurs.

  1. Physical Layer:
      Deals with the physical transmission of raw data bits across a network medium like cables or wireless signals.
      Examples: Cables, connectors, network cards.

  2. Data Link Layer:
      Focuses on error-free transmission of data frames between network devices on the same physical link.
      Takes the raw data from the Physical layer and packages it into frames, adding error correction codes.
      Examples: MAC addresses, error detection and correction (CRC).

  3. Network Layer:
      Responsible for routing data packets across different network segments.
      Determines the best path for data to reach its destination on potentially complex networks.
      Examples: IP addresses, routing protocols.

  4. Transport Layer:
      Provides reliable data transfer services between applications on different devices.
      Segments data from upper layers into manageable packets, ensures delivery, and handles retransmission if needed.
      Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

  5. Session Layer:
      Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications communicating over a network.
      Coordinates dialog, data exchange, and session termination between applications.
      Examples: Session initiation and termination protocols.

  6. Presentation Layer:
      Deals with the presentation of data, ensuring it's understood by the receiving application.
      May handle data encryption, decryption, compression, and formatting.
      Examples: Data encryption/decryption, character set conversion.

  7. Application Layer:
      Provides network services directly to user applications.
      Examples: Web browsing (HTTP), file transfer (FTP), email (SMTP).

üîòProtocols ===>>
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Protocol is a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted between devices.

‚óè Network protocols: 
  These protocols define how data is formatted and transmitted over a network. Some common network protocols include:

  ‚óã Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):
    TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order. It does this by breaking      
    data into packets, sending them to the destination device, and then checking to make sure they arrive correctly. TCP is used      
    for applications like web browsing and email, where it's important that data arrives accurately.

  ‚óã User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
    UDP is a connectionless protocol that is faster than TCP, but it is not as reliable. UDP does not guarantee that data will 
    arrive accurately or in the order it was sent. UDP is used for applications like streaming video and online gaming, where 
    speed is more important than accuracy.

  ‚óã Internet Protocol (IP):
    IP is the protocol that is responsible for routing data packets over the internet. IP addresses are used to identify devices 
    on the internet.

‚óè Application protocols:
  Application protocols are the language applications use to talk to each other on a network. They define how data is exchanged 
  between software applications to perform specific tasks like web browsing, sending emails, or file transfers.

  ‚óã Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (80): 
    The foundation of the web, HTTP is used to transfer web pages and data between web servers and browsers. Whenever you visit 
    a website, your browser uses HTTP to communicate with the server and request or display information.

  ‚óã Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (587):  
    This protocol handles the transfer of emails between servers. When you send an email, SMTP moves it from your email client        
    (like Outlook) to the recipient's mail server.

  ‚óã File Transfer Protocol (FTP) (20, 21):  
    This workhorse protocol allows for file transfers between computers. FTP establishes a connection for users to upload or 
    download files from remote servers.

  ‚óã Domain Name System (DNS) (53):  
    Not exactly user-facing, but crucial behind the scenes, DNS translates user-friendly domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) 
    into numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate servers.

  ‚óã Post Office Protocol (POP3) (110, 995):  
    This protocol retrieves emails from a mail server to your email client. POP3 downloads emails to your device, allowing you to 
    read them even when offline.

  ‚óã Secure Sockets Layer/Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (SSL/HTTPS) (443): 
    This secure version of HTTP encrypts communication between a web browser and server. HTTPS is used for sensitive transactions     
    like online banking or shopping, where data privacy is critical.

  ‚óã SSH Secure Shell (22): 
    It's a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure communication between two computers over an unsecured network.
    Imagine SSH as a secure encrypted tunnel you can use to access and control a remote computer or transfer files safely, even      
    over public Wi-Fi networks.

  many other application protocols used for various purposes, like streaming video (RTP), instant messaging (IRC), or managing      
  network devices (SNMP).

üîòNetwork System ===>>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Network services are the backbone of any network, allowing devices and users to communicate and share resources. They operate at the 
application layer (layer 7) of the OSI model and provide a variety of functionalities.

‚óè Types of Network Services:

  o File and Print Sharing: 
    Allows users to access and share files and printers on the network.
  
  o Directory Services: 
    Organize and manage user accounts, passwords, and other network resources.
  
  o Web Services: 
    Form the foundation of the internet, enabling communication between web servers and web browsers.
  
  o Communication Services: 
    Facilitate communication through email, instant messaging, or video conferencing.
  
  o Remote Access Services: 
    Allow users to securely access and control remote computers.
  
  o Database Services: 
    Manage and provide access to structured data in a centralized location.
  
  o Security Services: 
    Implement security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption to protect network resources.

üîòDHCP ===>>
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It's a network protocol that automates the process of assigning IP addresses 
and other network configuration settings to devices on a network.

‚óè Dynamic Leasing:
  o DHCP doesn't permanently assign IP addresses. Instead, it leases them to devices for a configured period (typically a few days or weeks).
  o Once the lease expires, the device can renew it or obtain a new IP address from the DHCP server.
  o This dynamic leasing allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, especially in situations where devices come and go on the 
    network frequently, like laptops or smartphones.
